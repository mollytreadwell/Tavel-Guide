   <b> Cape Cod</b>
   <br>
   "The Cape" is one of the most popular summer spots around, why? Because there is SO MUCH TO DO! Sure, you can get your bronze aside some of the most expansive, untouched views of the Atlantic you'll see in the US; you can eat lobster rolls and drink margaritas and bike nearly the entire length of the narrow peninsula (although, maybe not in that order); you can watch classic movies at the drive in, play mini golf, watch marine life IN REAL LIFE... but that would only be scratching the surface of this amazingly unique slice of heaven. 
    <br>
    <br>
    One of the best things about Cape Cod is how easy it is to get there. You can drive the scenic and direct route from Boston, you can take the CapeFLYER passenger train, you can take one of the Fast Ferries from Boston Harbor, you can fly into one of the TWO airports (one in Barnstable, one in Provincetown, both very small, but am option nonetheless), you can take a bus, you can even ride your bike if you wanted (probably still better than some of the bus options). The form of transportation doesn't matter, the only thing that does is that you get there! 
   <br>
    <i>The ferry from Boston is my personal favorite way to get out there</i> <a href= "https://baystatecruisecompany.com/"> . </a> The feel of motoring across Cape Cod Bay, the anticipation of docking in P-town's colorful downtown, the full bar menu... let's just say it's a pretty decent travel option.
<br>
  <br> 
So, you've mini golfed to your hearts desire and you're burnt from too many beach days? Fine! The arts and culture scene on the Cape is huge. Nearly every town has a number of incredible galleries, live music and theatre can be accessed on a daily basis, and you can even learn a new skill through programs like those held at Truro's Castle Hill Center for the Arts.
